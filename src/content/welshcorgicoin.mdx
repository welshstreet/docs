# The Pioneer of MemeFi on Stacks

Welshcorgicoin, commonly known as WELSH, is the first dog coin built on Bitcoin through the Stacks layer-2 blockchain. Recognized by Stacks as its official mascot and ambassador, WELSH has transcended typical meme coin status to become a beloved symbol across the Bitcoin and Stacks ecosystems.

## Bitcoin-Native Architecture

Unlike meme coins on other blockchains, WELSH leverages Stacks' unique Bitcoin-anchored architecture. Through the unique Proof-of-Transfer consensus mechanism, every Stacks block bundles all the Stacks transactions and settles as transactions on Bitcoin.  This means every WELSH transaction is ultimate written to Bitcoin.

## Community Tokenomics

WELSH implemented a fixed-supply model of 10 billion tokens, creating digital scarcity like Bitcoin's capped supply.  All 10 billion tokens were minted in a single transaction during the [contract deployment](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/SP3NE50GEXFG9SZGTT51P40X2CKYSZ5CC4ZTZ7A2G.welshcorgicoin-token?chain=mainnet&tab=overview) known as the *Great Welsh TGE*

  (try! (ft-mint? welshcorgicoin u10000000000000000 contract-creator)) 
)
```

This differentiates WELSH from inflationary meme coins and positions it as a potential store of value.

The fixed supply provides:
- **Scarcity Premium**: Limited supply drives value appreciation
- **Anti-Dilution**: Holders maintain ownership percentages indefinitely
- **Institutional Appeal**: Attracts serious investors alongside retail participants
- **Wide Distribution**: Four years of natural ecosystem distribution
- **Community Ownership**: Holders collectively drive the project's future
- **Proof of Time**: Sustained engagement demonstrating long-term viability

## Generational Welsh Movement

For years, DeFi was exclusive to other blockchains while Bitcoin remained primarily a store of value. WELSH has been instrumental in bringing DeFi to Bitcoin, making it accessible to everyone.

With all the tokens in circulation and more than +10,000 wallets holding tokens, WELSH's distribution exemplifies true decentralization.  The original developers stepped back entirely, allowing the community to assume full control and allowing for other projects to build on top of the WELSH community ethos, such as WELSH STREET.

As the first Bitcoin-native meme coin, WELSH established the template for future projects seeking Bitcoin's security benefits while maintaining community-driven culture. Today, the WELSH community represents one of the most active and engaged communities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. 

## Future

 While WELSH achieved decentralization and organic adoption across 10,000+ wallets, it faced the same challenge that limits all community tokens face: Full distribution means no yield or liquidity rewards.
