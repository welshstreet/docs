## Generational Welsh

Welshcorgicoin (WELSH) was the first dog-themed community token deployed on the Stacks blockchain, anchoring its history to Bitcoin through Stacks’ Layer-2 architecture. Recognized within the Stacks ecosystem as an [official mascot and ambassador](https://www.stacks.co/explore/ecosystem?category=All+Teams#tokens), WELSH has evolved beyond a typical meme token into a widely recognized cultural asset within Bitcoin-native communities.

For many years, decentralized finance primarily developed on non-Bitcoin blockchains while Bitcoin remained a store-of-value network. WELSH emerged during the early growth of Stacks and contributed to expanding meme culture within the Bitcoin-secured ecosystem.

As Bitcoin Layer-2 infrastructure continues to mature, more users are exploring ways to participate in Bitcoin-native economic activity. Through Stacks' [Proof-of-Transfer (POX) consensus mechanism](https://www.stacks.co/learn/stacking), users may receive Bitcoin rewards by participating in the network. Within the Welsh community, long-term participation in Bitcoin-secured ecosystems is often referred to as *Generational Welsh* — a cultural expression reflecting long-term conviction rather than short-term speculation.

## Built on Bitcoin

WELSH operates on the Stacks blockchain, which anchors its blocks to Bitcoin through the PoX consensus mechanism. Stacks transactions are settled to Bitcoin, meaning WELSH benefits from Bitcoin’s underlying security model while enabling smart contract functionality on Stacks.

This architecture differentiates WELSH from meme tokens deployed on non-Bitcoin chains, as its transaction history ultimately settles on Bitcoin.

## Community Tokenomics

WELSH follows a fixed-supply model of 10 billion tokens. The entire supply was minted in a single transaction known as the *Great Welsh TGE* at [contract deployment](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/SP3NE50GEXFG9SZGTT51P40X2CKYSZ5CC4ZTZ7A2G.welshcorgicoin-token?chain=mainnet&tab=overview)

(begin
  (try! (ft-mint? welshcorgicoin u10000000000000000 contract-creator)) 
)
```

No additional tokens can be minted and no mechanism exists to reduce supply. This creates a non-dilutive monetary base where holder ownership percentages are not subject to inflation.

Over time, distribution has occurred through open market activity and community participation. There were no programmed ongoing emissions, no embedded inflation schedule, and no subsequent mint events.

| Value Proposition | WELSH |
|-------------------|:-----:|
| **Fixed Supply**: | ☑️ |
| **No Inflation Mechanism** | ☑️ |
| **Full Initial Mint** | ☑️ |
| **Community-Driven Distribution** | ☑️ |
| **Bitcoin-Anchored Settlement** | ☑️ |

## Built on Welsh

Following the initial deployment, development became community-driven. Independent contributors and builders have created tools, integrations, and applications inspired by WELSH.

Welsh Street is one such application. By building a purpose-designed exchange around WELSH as a fixed monetary base, Welsh Street extends WELSH from a community symbol into an asset integrated within a structured DeFi market.
