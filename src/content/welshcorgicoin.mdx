# WELSH: The Pioneer of MemeFi on Stacks

## Built on Bitcoin

WelshCorgiCoin, commonly known as WELSH, is the first dog coin built on Bitcoin through the Stacks layer-2 blockchain. This achievement symbolizes the convergence of Bitcoin's security and meme coin culture, creating a new paradigm in digital assets.

Born from the passionate Stacks community, WELSH embodies the playful yet determined spirit of the Welsh Corgi breed. Just as Corgis are known for their loyalty and tenacity despite their size, WELSH has demonstrated remarkable resilience and community-driven growth.

Recognized by Stacks as its official mascot and ambassador, WELSH has transcended typical meme coin status to become a beloved symbol across the Bitcoin and Stacks ecosystems.

## Bitcoin-Native Architecture

Unlike meme coins on other blockchains, WELSH leverages Stacks blockchain's unique Bitcoin-anchored architecture Every WELSH transaction benefits from Bitcoin's security model while enabling smart contract functionality.

This foundation provides critical advantages:
- **Bitcoin Security**: All transactions secured by Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus
- **True Finality**: Settlement backed by the world's most secure blockchain
- **Innovation Layer**: Smart contract capabilities with Bitcoin's core principles

## Tokenomics & Supply Mechanics

WELSH implements a fixed supply model of 10 billion tokens, creating digital scarcity like Bitcoin's capped supply. This differentiates WELSH from inflationary meme coins and positions it as a potential store of value.

The fixed supply provides:
- **Scarcity Premium**: Limited supply drives value appreciation
- **Anti-Dilution**: Holders maintain ownership percentages indefinitely
- **Institutional Appeal**: Attracts serious investors alongside retail participants
- **Wide Distribution**: Four years of natural ecosystem distribution
- **Community Ownership**: Holders collectively drive the project's future
- **Proof of Time**: Sustained engagement demonstrating long-term viability

## The Generational Welsh Movement

For years, DeFi was exclusive to other blockchains while Bitcoin remained primarily a store of value. WELSH has been instrumental in bringing DeFi to Bitcoin, making it accessible to everyone.

With all the tokens in circulation and more than +10,000 wallets holding tokens, WELSH's distribution exemplifies true decentralization.  The original developers stepped back entirely, allowing the community to assume full control and allowing for other projects to build on top of the WELSH community ethos, such as Welsh Street.

As the first Bitcoin-native meme coin, WELSH established the template for future projects seeking Bitcoin's security benefits while maintaining community-driven culture. Today, the WELSH community represents one of the most active and engaged communities in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
