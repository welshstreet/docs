## Generational Welsh

Welshcorgicoin, commonly known as WELSH, is the first dog coin built on Bitcoin through the Stacks layer-2 blockchain. Recognized by Stacks as an [official mascot and ambassador](https://www.stacks.co/explore/ecosystem?category=All+Teams#tokens), WELSH has transcended typical meme coin status to become a beloved symbol across the Bitcoin and Stacks ecosystems.

For years, DeFi was exclusive to other blockchains while Bitcoin remained primarily a store of value. WELSH has been instrumental in bringing the fun and exciting meme culture to Bitcoin and Stacks, inspiring a new generation of Bitcoin-native projects.

As Bitcoin Layer-2s mature and more users are looking for ways to earn native Bitcoin yield, WELSH stands to inspire and attract more users to the Stacks ecosystem.  Only in Stacks can users earn a native Bitcoin yield through the [Proof-of-Transfer (POX) consensus mechanism](https://www.stacks.co/learn/stacking).  Earning native Bitcoin yield as colloquially became know as earning *Generational Wealth*. If WELSH inspires and helps onboard users to Bitcoin and Stacks, we refer to this as *Generational Welsh* 

## Built on Bitcoin

Unlike meme coins on other blockchains, WELSH leverages Stacks' unique Bitcoin-anchored architecture. Through POX, every Stacks block bundles all the Stacks transactions and settles as transactions on Bitcoin.  This means every WELSH transaction is ultimate written to Bitcoin.

## Community Tokenomics

WELSH implemented a fixed-supply model of 10 billion tokens, creating digital scarcity like Bitcoin's capped supply.  All 10 billion tokens were minted in a single transaction during the [contract deployment](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/SP3NE50GEXFG9SZGTT51P40X2CKYSZ5CC4ZTZ7A2G.welshcorgicoin-token?chain=mainnet&tab=overview) known as the *Great Welsh TGE*

(begin
  (try! (ft-mint? welshcorgicoin u10000000000000000 contract-creator)) 
)
```

Over the years, WELSH's distribution has been entirely organic, with no pre-mines, team allocations, or centralized sales. The combination of fixed-supply and full-distribution differentiates WELSH and other community meme coins from the typical *pump-and-dump* meme coins in many ways.

| Value Proposition | WELSH | Pump & Dumps |
|-------------------|:-----:|:------------:|
| **Fixed Supply**: Creates scarcity premium and value appreciation | ✔️ | ✖️ |
| **Anti-Dilution**: Holders maintain ownership percentages indefinitely | ✔️ | ✖️ |
| **Investment Appeal**: Attracts institutions and retail | ✔️ | ✖️ |
| **Wide Distribution**: Four years of natural ecosystem distribution | ✔️ | ✖️ |
| **Community Ownership**: Participants collectively drive the project's future | ✔️ | ✖️ |
| **Proof of Time**: Sustained engagement demonstrating long-term viability | ✔️ | ✖️ |

## Built on Welsh

The *Generational Welsh* movement and being *Built on Bitcoin* is what inspired the Welsh Street Exchange. After the Great TGE, original developers stepped back entirely. This allowed the community to assume full control of the protocol and opened the door for other developers to innovate and build projects inspired-by WELSH.

As the first dedicated meme-rewards exchange built on top of a single meme coin, the Welsh Street Exchanges establishes a template for future developers seeking to build projects with Bitcoin's security benefits, and strong community-driven ethos. WELSH is built-on Bitcoin, so Welsh Street is built-on WELSH. 

## Join the Movement

Today, the Welsh Community represents one of the most active and engaged communities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. You can join the Generational Welsh Movement and connect with the community through the following channels:
