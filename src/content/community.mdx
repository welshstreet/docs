# Community Coins

Community coins emerged within the Bitcoin Layer-2 ecosystem as an extension of core Bitcoin principles: fixed supply, open participation, and minimal centralized control.

Unlike many token launches that retain large allocations for teams, treasuries, or venture investors, community coins typically distribute their entire supply at or near genesis. This removes ongoing mint authority and reduces structural dilution risk.

When all tokens are in circulation and broadly distributed, price influence becomes more diffuse and dependent on open market activity rather than centralized decision-making.

WELSH is one such community token. Over time, it has reached distribution across thousands of wallets within the Stacks ecosystem. Its fixed-supply and broad ownership structure align with Bitcoin’s non-dilutive monetary ethos.

However, this structure introduces an important challenge shared by most fixed-supply community tokens.

## The Paradox

On paper, a fully distributed, fixed-supply token represents strong monetary neutrality. There is no central treasury, no emission schedule, and no administrative mint authority.

But in open markets, tokens must compete for liquidity, attention, and participation.

Projects that retain token reserves or ongoing emissions often use those tokens to incentivize liquidity providers, traders, and ecosystem participants. Community coins, by design, do not have that built-in incentive layer.

> A fixed-supply token eliminates dilution — but it also eliminates native incentive mechanisms.

This creates the community coin paradox: monetary purity can limit liquidity incentives.

## Missing Liquidity Incentives

Liquidity is essential for any tradable asset. It allows buyers and sellers to transact efficiently and enables price discovery.

In decentralized exchanges, liquidity providers deposit token pairs into pools and earn trading fees. While trading fees can generate returns over time, fee revenue alone may not be sufficient to attract sustained liquidity participation, particularly in early-stage ecosystems.

Many token ecosystems introduce emissions, staking rewards, or time-based incentives to encourage liquidity provisioning. These mechanisms introduce new token supply to reward participants.

Community coins with fixed supply do not have this option. With no treasury allocation and no inflation mechanism, additional incentives must come from external sources.

This constraint does not invalidate the fixed-supply model — but it does limit the tools available to stimulate liquidity growth.

## The Bitcoin Effect

Bitcoin is widely recognized for its fixed terminal supply. However, its supply schedule includes ongoing issuance for more than a century through block rewards.

Bitcoin’s block reward mechanism distributes new BTC to miners approximately every ten minutes. Miners, who invest capital and operational resources into securing the network, may sell a portion of their block rewards to cover costs.

This process introduces continuous market activity. New Bitcoin enters circulation regularly, facilitating liquidity, price discovery, and market participation.

The presence of controlled, declining issuance has historically supported:

<div className="advantage">
| Structural Outcome | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Ongoing Liquidity** | New supply regularly enters the market |
| **Entry Opportunities** | New participants can acquire newly issued BTC |
| **Market Activity** | Continuous buying and selling support price discovery |
| **Economic Sustainability** | Incentives align network participants with system security |
</div>

Community coins like WELSH do not include an emission schedule. All tokens exist at genesis, and no new supply enters the market through protocol-level incentives.

This structure preserves scarcity, but it does not inherently create recurring liquidity incentives.

<div className="disadvantage">
| Structural Limitation | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **No Native Emissions** | No protocol-level incentive layer |
| **Limited Liquidity Incentives** | Rewards must come from fees or voluntary contributions |
| **Static Supply** | No mechanism to introduce new market flow |
</div>

## The Missing Economic Engine

A fixed-supply community token can function as a store-of-value and cultural asset. However, without a complementary incentive mechanism, liquidity growth depends entirely on voluntary participation and organic trading.

This is the structural gap Welsh Street is designed to address.

By introducing a separate, fixed-emission rewards asset (STREET) paired against the fixed-supply base asset (WELSH), Welsh Street creates a market structure that preserves WELSH’s scarcity while adding a recurring incentive layer.
