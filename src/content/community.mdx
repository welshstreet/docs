# Community Coins 

Following core tenets of Bitcoin ethos, such as fixed-supply and no centralized control, community coins have become popular in the Bitcoin layer-2 ecosystem.  Mostly an organic response to pump & dump meme coins, community meme coins aim to eliminate the ability for teams and developers, who frequently retain large quantities of tokens, to sell vast sums of tokens or withdrawal large quantities of token from liquidity pools. These large selling events or liquidity withdrawals create the huge dumps seen across the different crypto ecosystems. 

When all the tokens are in circulation, and well-distributed, it is very difficult for a single-entity to control a token's price. 

WELSH achieved organic adoption across 10,000+ wallets and became the pioneer of community coins in the Stacks ecosystem. However, WELSH does face some challenges that all community tokens face: Full-distribution and fixed-supply means limited incentives for liquidity providers.

## The Paradox

On paper, WELSH represents the perfect community coin — truly decentralized with a fixed 10 billion token supply, no central authority, and incredible distribution across over 10,000 wallets. Of those 10,000 wallets, only 10 wallets hold more than 1% of the supply. Most of these 1% wallets are contracts for liquidity pools.

Here's the problem:

> Community coins have to compete with the tokenomics of traditional meme coins.

Whether traditional meme coins are called pump & dumps, VC coins, or centralized coins, these projects have significant advantages over community coins.

## Missing Liquidity Incentives

Cryptocurrency projects live and die by liquidity.  Liquidity refers to tokens being paired with other tokens to enable trading. For example, if a user wants to swap STX for WELSH (sell STX to buy WELSH), the user needs to find a liquidity pool where liquidity providers have deposited STX and WELSH tokens to facilitate the swaps.

In return for depositing liquidity (both sides of a trading pair), liquidity providers generally earn a small trading fee on each trade. While these trading fees can add up over time, they are typically not enough to drive an entire ecosystem or economy.

Traditional projects retain large sums of tokens to attract and incentivize liquidity providers.  Projects will offer rewards or emissions to users who deposit tokens into their liquidity pools.  There are other mechanisms such a staking or time-locks that allow liquidity providers to earn more rewards they longer they commit tokens. 

> With no team, no treasury, no vast-sums of token withheld and all tokens in circulation, community coins cannot offer the extra incentives to liquidity.

The entire supply of WELSH has been minted and distributed. Therefore the only way to pool additional rewards for liquidity incentives is by donations from holders. Albeit donations are a noble cause, donations alone cannot create a sustainable ecosystem. 

## The Bitcoin Effect

Bitcoin is frequently praised for having a fixed-supply. For the first time in human history a base money exists with a digitally verifiable fixed-supply. However, there is something misleading.

> Bitcoin's fixed supply goes into effect 33 halving cycles after genesis or in approximately 140.

The major point being Bitcoin is an inflationary asset for 140 years. The inflationary nature of Bitcoin helps create a robust and sustainable economy of buying and selling, which leads to an economic engine.

A Bitcoin block is mined every 10 minutes by miners. Miners are physical hardware nodes that spend electricity to solve complex hash algorithms. Every 10 minutes, a *block reward* or batch of bitcoins include in the block, is transferred to the winner miner.

Miners are arguably the most bullish Bitcoin holders.  Miners invest great sums of money to build bitcoin mining infrastructure that exposes them to a broad spectrum of risks include technical, jurisdiction, legislative, financial and economic risks. Despite all the risks, mines continue to maintain the Bitcoin network. However, to maintain all the Bitcoin mining infrastructure, miners sell Bitcoin.

The inflation schedule makes it possible. When miners sell Bitcoin they essentially transfer that Bitcoin to the open market.  With Bitcoin available to buy existing and new market entrants can buy Bitcoin.  If miners did not sell Bitcoin, there would be no Bitcoin to buy, and there would be no Bitcoin market.

Here are some of the benefits of Bitcoin's inflation.

<div className="advantage">
| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| ✔️ **Continuous Market Activity** | Miner sell pressure creates market buy pressure |
| ✔️ **Entry Opportunities** | New participants have an opportunity to acquire bitcoin |
| ✔️ **Market Dynamics** | Drive adoption and infrastructure growth |
| ✔️ **Price Discovery** | Supply and demand dynamics drive markets |
</div>

Community coins like WELSH have no inflation schedule. All the coins are in circulation and there is no mechanism for anyone to earn more WELSH. The lack of new WELSH entering the market creates some major disadvantages. 

<div className="disadvantage">
| Disadvantage | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| ✖️ **No Continuous Market Activity** | No new tokens are entering circulation |
| ✖️ **No New Entry opportunities** | Holders are not consistently selling |
| ✖️ **No Market Dynamics** | Adoption becomes saturated and growth stops |
| ✖️ **No Price Discovery** | Without arbitrage, supply & demands ceases to exist |
</div>

## The Missing Economic Engine

Without new issuance to drive market dynamics or economic incentives for liquidity providers, idle WELSH assets have no growth mechanism. The token functions as a store of value and community symbol, but lacks the financial engine necessary to drive sustained economic growth and adoption.
