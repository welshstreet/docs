# Tokenomics Overview

The tokenomic section explains the STREET issuance economics, how emissions are executed on-chain, how the initial supply is allocated. The tokenomics are broken down into the three main areas below:

- **Issuance** explains the long-run fixed-emission supply policy and comparisons to fixed supply and fixed inflation policies including the economic tradeoffs between scarcity and rewards incentives of each model.

- **Emissions** covers the on-chain execution mechanics: how Bitcoin blocks pace rewards, how epochs work, and triggering emission-mint events.

- **Distribution** details the initial supply allocation of STREET at launch including allocations to initial liquidity and the initial distribution to the community.

## Baseline: 10B

STREET follows a perpetual fixed-emission supply model. Because infinite-supply tokens lack a natural terminal value for modeling, a finite baseline is required to make practical economic projections and analyses. Therefore, all tokenomics models and analyses use a 10 Billion token baseline to mirror WELSH's 10B fixed-supply cap.

At genesis, 3,000,000,000 STREET (30%) is allocated directly to the community through the Genesis NFT event. An additional 2,000,000,000 STREET is minted at `street-token` contract deployment to provision the initial liquidity. This establishes an initial supply of 5,000,000,000 tokens.

## Definitions

Definitions below are provided in the context of this documentation and reflect how the terms are used throughout these pages.

### Bitcoin Block

A Bitcoin block is the preferred pacing signal for emissions. Referred to `burn-block-height` in Clarity smart contracts.

### Cycle

A cycle is the modeling unit used for annualized rates and plots (52,500 epochs ≈ 1 year).

### Disinflationary

Disinflationary means the inflation rate declines over time, even if new tokens continue to be issued.

### Distribution

Distribution describes how STREET supply is allocated at launch and through ongoing emissions, including the shares reserved for liquidity incentives.

### Emissions

Emissions are the on-chain mint events that produce and distribute STREET rewards over time.

## Emission Mint

Calling the `street-token` `mint()` function via the `emission-controller` contract. 

### Epoch

An epoch is one successful `emission-mint` execution. Epochs are programmatically limited to a maximum of 1 epoch per `burn-block-height`.

### Fixed Emissions

Fixed emissions means a constant amount of STREET is minted per issuance event, producing linear supply growth.

### Fixed Inflation

Fixed inflation means supply grows at a fixed percentage rate per year, which mechanically compounds over time.

For the Fiat-style reference model in `issuance`, the annual inflation rate used in calculations is 3.29% (average US dollar inflation from 1914–2026 based on CPI).

### Fixed Supply

Fixed supply means total supply is capped, typically via an issuance schedule that reduces emissions over time and approaches a terminal limit.

### Issuance

Issuance describes the long-run supply policy (the rule that determines how total supply changes over time).

## Street Mint

Calling the `street-token` `mint()` function via the `street-controller` contract.
