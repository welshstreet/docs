# Tokenomics Overview

This section explains how STREET is issued, how emissions are executed on-chain, how the initial supply is allocated, and how future governance can change the long-run supply policy. 

Read:

- `issuance` for the economic models
- `emission` for contract mechanics and triggers
- `distribution` for allocation and launch structure
- `future governance` for the one-way kill switch and the emission-controller attachment point

## Definitions

Definitions below are provided in the context of this documentation and reflect how the terms are used throughout these pages.

### Bitcoin Block

A Bitcoin block is the preferred pacing signal for emissions.

### Cycle

A cycle is the modeling unit used for annualized rates and plots (52,500 epochs ≈ 1 year).

### Disinflationary

Disinflationary means the inflation rate declines over time, even if new tokens continue to be issued.

### Distribution

Distribution describes how STREET supply is allocated at launch and through ongoing rewards, including the shares reserved for liquidity incentives and ecosystem operations.

### Emissions

Emissions are the on-chain mint events that produce and distribute STREET rewards over time.

### Epoch

An epoch is one successful `emission-mint` execution.

### Fixed Emissions

Fixed emissions means a constant amount of STREET is minted per issuance event, producing linear supply growth.

### Fixed Inflation

Fixed inflation means supply grows at a fixed percentage rate per year, which mechanically compounds over time.

For the Fiat-style reference model in `issuance`, the annual inflation rate used in calculations is 3.29% (average US dollar inflation from 1914–2026 based on CPI).

### Fixed Supply

Fixed supply means total supply is capped, typically via an issuance schedule that reduces emissions over time and approaches a terminal limit.

### Issuance

Issuance describes the long-run supply policy (the rule that determines how total supply changes over time).
