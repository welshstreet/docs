# Distribution

STREET is designed around fixed emissions, which means long-run total supply depends on time. That makes an “infinite supply” framing useful for describing perpetual rewards, but it is not usable for initial allocations, percentage ownership, or valuation baselines.

The distribution model is designed to favor the community and the liquidity providers who keep the WELSH/STREET market active. Most of the allocation is directed to liquidity incentives and community-oriented distribution, with a smaller portion reserved for development and treasury needs.

For those purposes, the tokenomics model uses a 10,000,000,000 token baseline supply for STREET. This matches WELSH’s fixed supply of 10 Billion and aligns with the governance path where the kill switch can lock STREET into a terminal cap at that same scale.

Within this 10B baseline model, 5,000,000,000 STREET (50%) is reserved for emission rewards. The remaining 5,000,000,000 STREET (50%) is allocated to a strategic distribution to bootstrap the WELSH/STREET ecosystem.

## Minting Functions

The first minting path is `street-mint`, which is used for the initial strategic distribution and is hard-capped at 5B tokens.
Once that 5B cap is reached, additional STREET issuance must come from the rewards emission mechanism via `emission-mint`.

```clarity
;; Street mint function controls the initial mint

;; contract owner can mint in tranches for clear onchain accounting
(define-data-var street-minted uint u0) 

;; Street mint allocation (5 Billion Total)
(define-constant STREET_MINT_CAP u5000000000000000)

(define-public (street-mint (amount uint))
    (begin
        ;; Street mint cannot exceed 5B tokens
        (asserts! (<= (+ (var-get street-minted) amount) STREET_MINT_CAP)
            ERR_EXCEEDS_STREET_MINT_CAP)
        
        ;; Mints to deployer for distribution
        (try! (ft-mint? street amount tx-sender)) 
    )
)
```

The second minting path is `emission-mint`, which mints the fixed rewards amount and is authorized via the `emission-controller`.

```clarity
;; Emission mint the only other function to mint STREET

;; 10,000 STREET tokens
(define-constant EMISSION_AMOUNT u10000000000)

;; only one entity can call emission-mint
(define-data-var emission-controller principal tx-sender)

;; emission-mint epoch tracker
(define-data-var emission-epoch uint u0)

(define-public (emission-mint)
    (begin

      ;; Only one emission-mint call per bitcoin block
      (asserts! (not (is-eq burn-block-height last-mint)) ERR_EMISSION_INTERVAL)

      ;; Only the emission-controller can mint (initial the deployer)
      (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender (var-get emission-controller)) ERR_NOT_CONTRACT_OWNER)
      
      ;; emissions are tracked and enforced
      (var-set emission-epoch (+ (var-get emission-epoch) u1))
      (var-set last-mint-block burn-block-height)
    )
```

## Distribution Breakdown

The distribution model below uses the same 10,000,000,000 token baseline supply for STREET.

The distribution is intentionally weighted toward community ownership and market participation. On this 10B baseline, 90% of STREET is allocated outside of development, and 70% is directed specifically to liquidity: 50% to ongoing liquidity rewards and 20% to liquidity that is seeded and then removed from circulation over time.

The objective is to keep incentives and participation aligned with the system’s purpose: emissions support liquidity around WELSH, while the remaining allocations support launch structure and ongoing operations. The development allocation (10%) is the only portion that is not designed as a community or market-participation allocation.

### Emission Rewards 

**50%** - Half of the baseline supply is reserved for liquidity rewards emissions. STREET is emitted on an ongoing basis and distributed to WELSH/STREET liquidity providers. This allocation is what powers the rewards mechanism over time.

### Burned Liquidity

**20%** - An allocation is reserved to seed initial liquidity. The corresponding CREDIT tokens are removed from circulation over time to reinforce long-run alignment between the pool and community participation.

### Liquidity Generation Event (Genesis)

**10%** - Genesis establishes the initial market structure of the exchange. Early participants provide WELSH to pair against newly minted STREET, creating the initial WELSH/STREET liquidity pool.

### Development Allocation

**10%** - An allocation supports infrastructure, security work, hosting, upgrades, and continued development of the Welsh Street Exchange.

### Treasury Reserve

**10%** - An allocation is reserved for ecosystem growth initiatives and community-directed expansion of the Welsh Street economy.
