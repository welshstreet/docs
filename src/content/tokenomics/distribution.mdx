# Distribution

The STREET distribution model is 100% dedicated and designed to favor the community and the liquidity providers who keep the WELSH / STREET market active. There is no treasury or treasury allocation.  There is no initial developer allocation.  There are no investors and no initial coin offering to insiders.

Most of the allocation is directed to liquidity incentives and community-oriented distribution.

## Distribution Breakdown

The distribution model deploys 5,000,000,000 STREET including 2,000,000,000 to the initial liquidity pool and the 3,000,000,000 to the initial community allocation via the Genesis NFT event.

The objective is to keep incentives and participation aligned with the system’s purpose: emissions support liquidity around WELSH, while the remaining allocations support launch structure and ongoing operations.

### Emission Rewards 

**30%** of the baseline supply is reserved for the Genesis NFT event. STREET is minted to users who donate 1,000 WELSH to the rewards pool and mint a commemorative NFT. This allocation is what initial distributes STREET tokens to the community.

### Initial Liquidity 

**20%** - An allocation is minted on contract deployment to seed initial liquidity. The deployer pairs the STREET with WELSH to establish the initial liquidity pool. The WELSH is provided by the deployer with no investors or insiders.

## Minting functions

### Street Token

The main minting function is the `mint` function found in the STREET `street-token` contract.  This function mints STREET tokens and can only be called by the `street-controller` contract.

<div className="code-transparent">
```clarity
;; Mint function can only be called by .emission-controller or .street-controller

(define-public (mint (amount uint) (recipient principal))
    (begin
      (asserts!
        (or
          (is-eq contract-caller .emission-controller)
          (is-eq contract-caller .street-controller)
        )
        ERR_NOT_AUTHORIZED
      )
      (try! (ft-mint? street amount recipient))
      (ok true)
    )
)
```
</div>

During the deployment of the `street-token` contract, 2,000,000,000 STREET tokens are automatically minted to the deployer for initial liquidity.  There is no cap or function related to this mint event.  It can only be called once at contract deployment, similar to the way all 10,000,000,000 WELSH tokens were created at deployment. 

<div className="code-transparent">
```clarity
;; The Great Welsh $STREET TGE

(begin
  (try! (ft-mint? street u2000000000000000 (var-get contract-owner)))
)
```
</div>

### Street controller

The `street-controller` contract controls the minting of STREET, collection of WELSH donations from community members, updates the rewards pool and mints NFTs to the users. 

<div className="code-transparent">
```clarity
;; constants
(define-constant MINT_BONUS  u1000000000000)
(define-constant MINT_STREET  u100000000000)
(define-constant DONATE_WELSH   u1000000000)
(define-constant MINT_CAP            u21000)

;; variables
(define-data-var mint-count uint u0)

(define-map users principal uint)

(define-public (mint)
  (let (
      (user-welsh (unwrap-panic (contract-call? .welshcorgicoin get-balance tx-sender)))
      (count (+ (var-get mint-count) u1))
      (is-milestone (is-eq (mod count u21) u0))
      (mint-amount (if is-milestone MINT_BONUS MINT_STREET))
    )
    (begin
      (asserts! (>= user-welsh DONATE_WELSH) ERR_YOU_POOR)
      (asserts! (< (default-to u0 (map-get? users tx-sender)) u2) ERR_ALREADY_MINTED)
      (asserts! (<= count MINT_CAP) ERR_MINT_CAP)
      (try! (contract-call? .street-token mint mint-amount tx-sender))
      (try! (contract-call? .street-nft mint count tx-sender))
      (try! (contract-call? .welshcorgicoin transfer DONATE_WELSH tx-sender .street-rewards none))
      (try! (contract-call? .street-rewards update-rewards-a DONATE_WELSH))
      (map-set users tx-sender (+ (default-to u0 (map-get? users tx-sender)) u1))
      (var-set mint-count count)
    )
  )
)
```
</div>

### Street NFT

The `street-nft` contract mints the NFTs for the Welsh Street Genesis NFT event

<div className="code-transparent">
```clarity
;; public functions
(define-public (mint (token-id uint) (recipient principal))
  (let ((existing-tokens (default-to (list) (map-get? users recipient))))
    (begin
      (asserts! (is-eq contract-caller .street-controller) ERR_NOT_AUTHORIZED)
      (asserts! (<= token-id MINT_CAP) ERR_MINT_CAP)
      (try! (nft-mint? welsh-street-genesis-nft token-id recipient))
      (map-set users recipient (unwrap-panic (as-max-len? (append existing-tokens token-id) u2)))
      (ok token-id)
    )
  )
)
```
</div>

## Genesis NFT Event

The Genesis NFT event distributes 3,000,000,000 STREET tokens (30% of baseline supply) to community members through a public NFT mint. Each participant donates 1,000 WELSH to the rewards pool and receives a commemorative NFT paired with STREET tokens.

### Distribution Structure

The event uses a repeating cycle structure to distribute tokens:

- **Total NFTs**: 21,000 mints available
- **Cycle Length**: 21 mints per cycle
- **Total Cycles**: 1,000 cycles
- **WELSH Donated**: 21,000,000 total (1,000 per mint)

Each cycle distributes 3,000,000 STREET:
- **Positions 1-20**: 100,000 STREET per mint (standard distribution)
- **Position 21**: 1,000,000 STREET per mint (milestone bonus)

After each milestone mint at position 21, the cycle resets and begins again.

### NFT Characteristics

Each NFT includes visual elements based on token type and background theme:

**Token Types** (assigned by position):
- **Orange (welsh)**: 50% of standard mints (10,000 NFTs)
- **Blue (street)**: 50% of standard mints (10,000 NFTs)
- **Purple (credit)**: All milestone mints (1,000 NFTs)

**Background Themes** (distributed evenly):
- legends 🔴
- liquidity 🔵
- mint 🟢
- rewards 🟣
- swap 🟠
- transfer ⚫

Each background appears exactly 3,500 times across the 21,000 NFT collection.

### Technical Implementation

The mint process executes through the `street-controller` contract:

1. User calls mint function with sufficient WELSH balance
2. Contract verifies WELSH balance (≥1,000 WELSH)
3. Contract verifies user has not exceeded 2-mint limit
4. Contract verifies total mint count has not reached 21,000 cap
5. STREET tokens minted to user (amount based on cycle position)
6. NFT minted to user
7. WELSH transferred from user to rewards pool
8. Rewards pool updated with donated WELSH

### NFT Function

NFTs serve as commemorative tokens representing participation in the Genesis event. They do not confer:

- Governance rights
- Revenue sharing
- Special access or privileges
- Administrative control

The NFT represents the STREET token distribution received during the mint event.

### Launch Design

The protocol launches independently of mint completion. The exchange can function whether 10% or 100% of NFTs are minted, as initial liquidity is provided separately by the deployer. There is no pressure for full mint-out, allowing organic adoption over time.
