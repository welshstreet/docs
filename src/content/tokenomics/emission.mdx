## Bitcoin-Inspired Timing

## DOGE-Inspired Amount

Dogecoin started with a declining block-subsidy schedule, but once it reached its final reward epoch it switched to permanent fixed issuance: 10,000 DOGE per block. Because Dogecoin targets ~1-minute blocks, that becomes ~10,000 DOGE per minute in steady state. In Dogecoin Core, this is implemented as “constant inflation” after the last halving-era threshold (6 halving intervals × 100,000 blocks = 600,000).

Excerpt from Dogecoin Core (reward logic):

<div className="code-transparent">
```cpp
CAmount GetDogecoinBlockSubsidy(int nHeight, const Consensus::Params& consensusParams, uint256 prevHash) {
    int halvings = nHeight / consensusParams.nSubsidyHalvingInterval;

    if (!consensusParams.fSimplifiedRewards) {
        // Old-style rewards derived from the previous block hash
        ...
    } else if (nHeight < (6 * consensusParams.nSubsidyHalvingInterval)) {
        // New-style constant rewards for each halving interval
        return (500000 * COIN) >> halvings;
    } else {
        // Constant inflation
        return 10000 * COIN;
    }
}

Emitting 10,000 tokens every Bitcoin block until the gives community ample time to mature governance and make an informed decision. To the best of our knowledge, no one has ever launched an infinite supply token with the sole purpose of boosting a fixed-supply token. At the programmed emission rate, it will take about 5 years for the supply cap to be reached, so the community has plenty of time to debate, model and decide the best fate of the project.
