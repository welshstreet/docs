# Introduction

Welcome to **Welsh Street** - the world's first DeFi protocol built specifically to boost a single token, **WELSH**, Bitcoin's pioneering meme and first dog coin. Just as Wall Street drives traditional finance, Welsh Street creates the economic infrastructure and engine that transforms a beloved community meme token into a productive DeFi asset.

## Welsh Leads the Meme Revolution Again

Welsh Street represents a paradigm shift in DeFi meme coins - moving from singular tokens traded on multi-token exchanges to a **purpose-built exchange** designed boost and reward a single token. While WELSH achieved perfect decentralization and organic adoption across 10,000+ wallets, it faced the same challenge that limits all community tokens face: Full distribution means no yield or liquidity rewards.

Welsh Street transforms idle WELSH into productive DeFi asset through the world's first dedicated meme rewards token and tradable LP positions.

## What Makes Welsh Street Unique

**Dedicated Meme Rewards**: STREET tokens exist solely to reward WELSH liquidity providers, creating sustainable yield where none existed before.

**Tradable LP Positions**: Unlike other Stacks DEXs, your liquidity positions are tokenized as CREDIT - fully transferable, tradable, and composable across DeFi.

**Purpose-Built AMM**: Every feature optimized to boost the visibility of the WELSH/STREET economy, including features to burn and lock liquidity as well as donate rewards.

**Scalable Rewards**: Global Index mathematics ensure fairness whether we have 10 or 10,000 liquidity providers.

## The Welsh Economic Flywheel

Welsh Street doesn't just create another trading venue - it **activates a self-sustaining economic engine**:

1. **Utility Activation**: Idle WELSH paired with STREET earns yield through LP rewards
2. **Market Dynamics**: STREET sales create WELSH buy pressure and arbitrage opportunities
3. **Economic Expansion**: CREDIT secondary markets drive sustained growth and participation

## Built for Bitcoin's First Dog Meme

WELSH opened Bitcoin to meme coin culture as the first community token on Stacks blockchain. Now, Welsh Street opens WELSH to sophisticated DeFi yield and long term rewards, ensuring Bitcoin's beloved first dog meme has the economic infrastructure it deserves.
