# Welcome to Welsh Street

Welsh Street is a frontend interface to access immutable smart contracts that implement a DeFi exchange protocol. The protocol is designed to activate WELSH within a structured on-chain economy. Inspired by how Wall Street coordinates traditional capital markets, Welsh Street introduces a focused market architecture built around a fixed-supply base asset and a native rewards layer.

The exchange operates through fully autonomous smart contracts with no developer control post-deployment. All economic parameters are hardcoded as immutable constants.

## Bitcoin’s First Dog

WELSH was the first dog-themed community token deployed on the Stacks blockchain, anchoring its history to Bitcoin’s security model.

Welsh Street extends that foundation by integrating WELSH into a DeFi framework that includes liquidity provisioning, rewards distribution, and open market participation. The result is an environment where WELSH functions not only as a community asset, but as the monetary base of a purpose-built exchange.

## Welsh Street Exchange

The Welsh Street Exchange is a Uniswap V2-style Automated Market Maker centered on three core tokens:

- **WELSH** — a fixed-supply monetary base  
- **STREET** — a disinflationary rewards asset  
- **CREDIT** — a hybrid, tradable LP token (pool ownership and emission claims)

Liquidity providers pair WELSH and STREET to mint CREDIT.

### WELSH

WELSH is a community meme token with a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens, launched in 2021 as the first dog-themed token on the Stacks blockchain. It operates without centralized control, developer allocations, or ongoing inflation mechanisms.

### STREET

STREET is the rewards asset of the exchange. A fixed number of tokens are emitted per Bitcoin block and distributed to liquidity providers through the rewards contract.

Because emissions remain constant while total supply grows, STREET follows a disinflationary monetary model: supply increases linearly, while the inflation rate declines over time. This structure allows rewards to continue without introducing accelerating dilution.

### CREDIT

CREDIT represents ownership of the WELSH/STREET liquidity pool. CREDIT holders receive trading fees generated by exchange activity and may call the claim function to receive allocated STREET emissions.

CREDIT is a standard SIP-010 token and is fully transferable, enabling liquidity providers to maintain flexibility and secondary market participation.

There are no lock-up periods or mandatory staking contracts. Emissions are allocated per block and can be claimed at any time without withdrawing liquidity.

## Meme Rewards Protocol

The Meme Rewards protocol implements structured interaction between three core components:

- A fixed-supply base asset (WELSH)  
- A fixed-emission, disinflationary asset (STREET)
- A tradable LP token (CREDIT) that enables the pairing and emission claims

This WELSH / STREET pairing introduces continuous liquidity activity while preserving the scarcity of WELSH. The Meme Rewards Protocol layers the following mechanics on top of WELSH's fixed-supply foundation to create a structured economic framework.

### Liquidity Participation

WELSH can be paired with STREET in liquidity pools to mint CREDIT. This enables participation in the protocol's fee structure and emission distribution.

### Market Mechanics

STREET emissions create recurring incentives for participation. Participants may exchange STREET for WELSH within the pool, generating ongoing liquidity activity and fee production.

Because WELSH supply remains fixed while STREET supply expands, the system maintains asymmetric monetary properties within a single market structure.

### Network Integration

As participation increases, trading volume and fee generation may increase correspondingly. Interaction with external markets can introduce additional arbitrage and cross-market participation, further integrating the ecosystem within the broader Stacks environment.

### Community Participation

Liquidity participation, rewards distribution, and market activity deepen engagement within the Welsh ecosystem. As liquidity grows, the exchange becomes more efficient and accessible, reinforcing continued participation.

## Welsh Community Ethos

True to Welsh's decentralized spirit, Welsh Street operates with maximum decentralization:

| Protocol Characteristics | Description | Welsh Street |
|--------------------------|-------------|:------------:|
| **No Treasury** | No protocol-controlled funds | ☑️ |
| **No Reserves** | No hidden token allocations | ☑️ |
| **No Insiders** | No preferential access or off-chain pre-sale | ☑️ |
| **No Revenue** | No exchange fee extraction | ☑️ |
| **No Developer Allocation** | 0% team tokens | ☑️ |

Once deployed, the protocol executes autonomously according to its immutable code. Developers become ordinary community participants with no special privileges.

## We Welsh

In crypto, a common phrase is WAGMI — *We’re All Going to Make It.*

In the Welsh community, there is a simpler expression:

> We Welsh.
