# Welcome to Welsh Street

Welsh Street is a purpose-built DeFi exchange designed to activate WELSH within a structured on-chain economy. Inspired by how Wall Street coordinates traditional capital markets, Welsh Street introduces a focused market architecture built around a fixed-supply base asset and a native rewards layer.

The goal is simple: transform WELSH from a passive community token into an asset that participates in an active, self-sustaining market system.

## Bitcoin’s First Dog

WELSH was the first dog-themed community token deployed on the Stacks blockchain, anchoring its history to Bitcoin’s security model.

Welsh Street extends that foundation by integrating WELSH into a DeFi framework that includes liquidity provisioning, rewards distribution, and open market participation. The result is an environment where WELSH functions not only as a community asset, but as the monetary base of a purpose-built exchange.

## Welsh Street Exchange

The Welsh Street Exchange is a Uniswap V2-style Automated Market Maker centered on two core assets:

- **WELSH** — a fixed-supply monetary base  
- **STREET** — a disinflationary rewards asset  

Liquidity providers pair WELSH and STREET to mint **CREDIT**, a transferable LP token representing proportional ownership of the pool.

### STREET

STREET is the rewards asset of the exchange. A fixed number of tokens are emitted per Bitcoin block and distributed to liquidity providers through the rewards contract.

Because emissions remain constant while total supply grows, STREET follows a disinflationary monetary model: supply increases linearly, while the inflation rate declines over time. This structure allows rewards to continue without introducing accelerating dilution.

### CREDIT

CREDIT represents ownership of the WELSH/STREET liquidity pool. CREDIT holders earn trading fees generated by exchange activity and may claim allocated STREET emissions.

CREDIT is a standard SIP-010 token and is fully transferable, enabling liquidity providers to maintain flexibility and secondary market participation.

There are no lock-up periods or mandatory staking contracts. Rewards accrue automatically and can be claimed at any time without withdrawing liquidity.

## Welsh Monetary Engine

Welsh Street creates structured interaction between two distinct monetary policies:

- A fixed-supply base asset (WELSH)  
- A fixed-emission, disinflationary asset (STREET)

This pairing introduces continuous liquidity activity while preserving the scarcity of WELSH.

### Utility Activation

Idle WELSH can be deployed into liquidity pools to mint CREDIT. This converts static holdings into productive capital exposed to fee revenue and emission flows.

### Market Dynamics

STREET emissions create recurring incentives for participation. Participants may exchange earned STREET for WELSH within the pool, generating ongoing liquidity activity and fee production.

Because WELSH supply remains fixed while STREET supply expands, the system maintains asymmetric monetary properties within a single market structure.

### Economic Expansion

As participation increases, trading volume and fee generation may increase correspondingly. Interaction with external markets can introduce additional arbitrage and cross-market participation, further integrating the ecosystem within the broader Stacks environment.

### Community Participation

Liquidity participation, rewards distribution, and market activity deepen engagement within the Welsh ecosystem. As liquidity grows, the exchange becomes more efficient and accessible, reinforcing continued participation.

## We Welsh

In crypto, a common phrase is WAGMI — *We’re All Going to Make It.*

In the Welsh community, there is a simpler expression:

> We Welsh.
