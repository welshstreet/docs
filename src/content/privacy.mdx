# Privacy Policy

<Callout type="warning">When you sign the Terms of Service authorization message, we record your wallet address together with the date and time of that signature.</Callout>

This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and what we do not collect. The Welsh Street Exchange is designed with a **minimal-data approach**. We do not collect personal identifiers, IP addresses, or device fingerprints.

## What We Collect

- **Digital Message Signatures:** When you connect a wallet and sign a digital message to interoperate with the smart contracts, we record the **date, time, and wallet address** associated with that signature. This step is required to use the Exchange.

- **Wallet Activity (App-Scoped):** We record wallet addresses you connect to the Service and related on-chain actions taken in-app: swaps, providing/removing liquidity, and reward claims. We may store associated transaction hashes, timestamps, token symbols/amounts, and pool identifiers to operate, secure, and improve the Service.

- **Liquidity, Swap, and Rewards Transactions:** All such actions are logged with the **date, time, and wallet address** for analytics, UX improvements, and protocol monitoring.

- **Public Blockchain Data:** Blockchain data is inherently public. Anyone with access to the chain can observe transactions tied to your wallet address.

## What We Do *Not* Collect

- No names, emails, phone numbers, government IDs, or similar personal identifiers.
- No IP addresses and no device fingerprinting.
- No behavioral advertising cookies. Only essential cookies may be used to deliver the Service.
- No tax, accounting, or reporting data. Users are solely responsible for recording and reporting their own transactions for tax or regulatory purposes.

## Use of Data

We use the limited data collected to:
- Provide core functionality (e.g., enabling swaps, liquidity management, and rewards).
- Maintain security and prevent abuse.
- Perform aggregate analytics to improve user experience and optimize the Service.

We do not sell, trade, or monetize user data.

## Retention

We retain app-scoped logs only as long as reasonably necessary for operations, security, or compliance, or as required by law. If you wish to delete logs associated with your wallet address, you may contact us at [here](https://github.com/enjoywithouthey/WELSH-STREET-documentation/issues/new?title=Feedback%20for%20%E2%80%9CPrivacy%20Policy%E2%80%9D&labels=feedback) with your wallet address and relevant transaction hashes.

## Sharing

We may share data only with trusted service providers (e.g., hosting or security vendors) under contract and only for operational purposes. We may disclose data if required by law, regulation, or legal process, or to protect rights, safety, and the integrity of the Service.

## Security

We implement reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards; however, no system is perfectly secure. You remain responsible for safeguarding your own wallet, private keys, and seed phrase.

## Changes

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be posted with a new “Last updated” date. Continued use of the Service after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
