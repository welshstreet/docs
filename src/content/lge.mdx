# Liquidity Generation Event

## Summary

The **Liquidity Generation Event (LGE)** marks the **genesis** of the Welsh Street Exchange ecosystem.
It distributes **1,000,000,000 STREET tokens (10% of total supply)** to early contributors who send **WELSH** to the secure **genesis contract** during a **10-day event**.

- **Duration:** 10 days
- **Contribution asset:** WELSH
- **Distribution:** 1,000,000,000 STREET (10% of supply)
- **Goal:** 10,000,000 WELSH raised
- **Target ratio:** 1 WELSH : 100 STREET
- **Refunds:** None — all contributions are final
- **Liquidity:** None created during the LGE
- **Claim Period:** STREET distributed via user claim after contribution window closes.

## Overview

Participants contribute **WELSH** to the on-chain **genesis contract**.
Each contribution updates a cumulative map recording total WELSH per participant.

At the end of 10 days:
- The event closes.
- On-chain totals are finalized.
- **1,000,000,000 STREET** are distributed to contributors **pro-rata** to their share of total WELSH raised.

### No Refunds

All contributions are **non-refundable**.
WELSH sent to the genesis contract permanently qualifies for the final STREET distribution.

## Mechanics

### 1. Contribution Window
- The event runs for **10 consecutive days**.
- Users may contribute **multiple times**; each new contribution adds to their cumulative total.
- Contributions are accepted only in **WELSH** via the genesis contract.

### 2. On-Chain Data (Source of Truth)
- The contract records:
- A **list of participant principals**.
- A **map of cumulative WELSH totals** per principal.
- These on-chain records are the **sole source** for the final distribution calculations.

### 3. Off-Chain Data (UX Only)
- An off-chain database mirrors on-chain events to power:
- Progress bars and contribution charts.
- Leaderboards and metadata (contribution amount, timestamp, etc.).
- **Only users who contribute through the frontend** have their metadata recorded.
- **Direct contract interactions** (via CLI, API, or Stacks Explorer) are **still valid** and fully credited in the final distribution,
but **their metadata will not appear** in the frontend display.

## Distribution Phase

After the 10-day window:
1. The genesis contract is closed.
2. Final contribution totals are exported from the blockchain.
3. **STREET tokens are distributed** via user claim through the genesis contract.
4. Distribution is based entirely on **on-chain totals** recorded by the genesis contract.

## Metadata & Privacy

| Method | On-Chain Record | Off-Chain Metadata | Displayed in Frontend |
|---------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Frontend (App)** | ✅ Contribution total | ✅ Wallet, timestamp, country flag | ✅ Yes |
| **Direct Contract Call (CLI/Explorer)** | ✅ Contribution total | ❌ None recorded | ❌ No |

All allocations are based solely on on-chain totals, regardless of frontend tracking.

## Tokenomics Summary

| Metric | Amount | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| STREET distributed | **1,000,000,000** | 10% of total supply |
| WELSH raise goal | **10,000,000** | Defines 1:100 ratio |
| Pool seed | **2,000,000,000 STREET + 20,000,000 WELSH** | Initial LP creation |
| Source of WELSH for pool | 10M from LGE seed + 10M private donations | No insider advantage |
| STREET source for pool | 2B minted by protocol | Treasury-locked |
| Initial valuation | ≈ $10,000 FDV | At $0.0001 WELSH / $0.000001 STREET |

## Oversubscription & Rewards Handling

The LGE can be **oversubscribed** — more than 10M WELSH may be contributed.
Excess WELSH is handled as follows:

| Contribution Level | Handling | Notes |
|--------------------|-----------|-------|
| **≤ 10M WELSH** | Normal distribution | Eligible for 1B STREET distribution |
| **10M – 20M WELSH** | Deducted from donation balance | Reduces donation pool 1:1 |
| **> 20M WELSH** | Donated to Rewards Pool | Distributed to LPs over 1–3 month bootstrap period |

The **contract administrator** determines the timing of reward donations to maintain fair, gradual distribution to LPs during early liquidity phases.

## Undersubscription Handling

If total WELSH raised is **less than 10M**:
- The **1B STREET allocation** is still distributed pro-rata, so participants receive **more STREET per WELSH**.
- The **initial liquidity pool** will still be created using **2B STREET + 20M WELSH**, with the shortfall covered by **private WELSH donations** (no insider advantage, no special allocations).

## Liquidity Pool Creation

After the LGE ends:

1. The deployer seeds the liquidity pool with
   **2B STREET + 20M WELSH**.
2. 10M WELSH originates from the LGE seed round;
   10M WELSH comes from private donations.
3. The deployer may fine-tune the ratio slightly to reflect actual WELSH raised or market price.

All liquidity is **protocol-owned** or **donated**, ensuring fair market depth at launch.

## Core Principles

1. **Fair Launch:**
 Every contributor participates under the same conditions. There are no pre-sales or private allocations.

2. **Transparency:**
 All contributions are recorded on-chain and viewable by anyone.

3. **Fixed STREET Supply:**
 Exactly 1,000,000,000 STREET are distributed through the LGE (10% of total supply)—no more, no less.

4. **Flexible Liquidity Ratio:**
 The 1:100 ratio between WELSH and STREET is a target goal.
 The deployer may adjust this ratio at the time of liquidity deployment to reflect actual WELSH raised or market conditions.

5. **Community Participation:**
 Major allocation choices (e.g., surplus or rewards handling) will be shared and discussed publicly through official Welsh Street social channels such as **X**.

## Market Adjustment & Liquidity Allocation Policy

Because the LGE runs for two weeks, the market price of **WELSH** may change significantly during the event.
To handle both **over-subscription** and **under-subscription** fairly, the following framework applies:

1. **Fixed STREET Allocation**
 The total of **1,000,000,000 STREET** distributed to participants does not change, regardless of market movements or total WELSH raised.

2. **Adjustable Liquidity Ratio**
 The **1 : 100** ratio between STREET and WELSH is **not hard-coded**.
 After the LGE ends, the deployer will apply the initial liquidity manually and may adjust this ratio to reflect actual market conditions and the total WELSH raised.

### Oversubscription Scenario (More than 10M WELSH Raised)

The LGE uses a structured approach to handle oversubscription:

**10M - 20M WELSH Range:**
- Excess WELSH (above 10M) is deducted from the donation balance pool
- This reduces the donation pool 1:1, maintaining fairness

**Above 20M WELSH:**
- Additional excess WELSH is donated to the **Rewards Pool**
- Distributed to LP holders over 1-3 month bootstrap period
- **Contract administrator** determines timing for fair, gradual distribution

The allocation decision will be announced **publicly on official channels (e.g., X)**, and community sentiment may be measured through polls.

### Undersubscription Scenario (Less than 10M WELSH Raised)

If less WELSH is raised than the 10M target:

- All participants still receive their full share of the **1,000,000,000 STREET allocation**, which means each WELSH contributed earns **more STREET**.
- The **initial liquidity pool** will still be created using **2B STREET + 20M WELSH**
- The shortfall is covered by **private WELSH donations** with no insider advantage or special allocations
- The deployer may fine-tune the ratio slightly to reflect actual market conditions

Undersubscription effectively rewards early supporters with a larger proportional STREET claim.

## Fairness & Transparency Framework

| Concern | Mechanism | Who Decides | Transparency |
|----------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Oversubscription | Excess to Rewards or Treasury | Contract admin, public notice | Announced on X |
| Undersubscription | Private WELSH added | Deployer | Public post-event summary |
| Reward pacing | Distributed over 1–3 months | Admin | Schedule published |
| Liquidity ratio | Adjustable at creation | Deployer | On-chain record |
| Donations | No insider allocations | N/A | Publicly verifiable |

## Deployer Authority & Community Input

- The deployer manages liquidity creation shortly after LGE close.
- Major decisions (e.g., how to use surplus WELSH) will be discussed publicly and may be put to community polls on X.
- After this window, ongoing reward pacing or buyback decisions will continue to be posted transparently through official social channels.
