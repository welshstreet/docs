# The Welsh Street Solution

Welsh Street Exchange solves the community coin dilemma by introducing the world's first dedicated meme rewards token and specialized AMM designed exclusively for WELSH holders.

## Welsh's Decentralized Exchange

Inspired by the pioneering spirit of WELSH, Welsh Street Exchange is a next-generation DeFi AMM built on Stacks blockchain that honors the legacy of Bitcoin's first dog coin while pushing the boundaries of DeFi innovation. Our protocol introduces the world's first dedicated meme rewards token (STREET) and tradable LP token (CREDIT) architecture to create sustainable yield for liquidity providers.

Welsh Street was born from the recognition that WELSH deserved a proper rewards system and economic model — which required a sophisticated DeFi platform that could match the innovation and community spirit of WELSH. 

## The Street Credit Ecosystem

Welsh Street Exchange operates through three interconnected tokens that create an economic engine. The STREET token functions as a money printer for WELSH liquidity providers, with 10,000 tokens minted every Bitcoin block in alignment with Bitcoin's own emission schedule. Half of STREET's total supply—5 billion tokens—is reserved exclusively for LP rewards, while STREET's unique utility ensures it can only be swapped for WELSH, creating permanent buy pressure on WELSH.

The CREDIT token makes LP positions tradable assets. Unlike other Stacks DEXs where LP positions remain locked in internal accounting, CREDIT tokens enable secondary markets and transferable ownership. Liquidity providers can claim STREET rewards while maintaining their LP position, or implement compounding strategies by pairing earned STREET with additional WELSH to mint more CREDIT.

The Welsh Street Exchange itself serves as the purpose-built AMM for this new Welsh economy. STREET to WELSH swaps create arbitrage opportunities that generate a Welsh premium, establishing the exchange as both an economic engine and growth catalyst that drives continuous trading activity and expands WELSH's utility across the ecosystem.

## A Welsh Economic Flywheel

The Welsh Street economic model mirrors Bitcoin's relationship with traditional fiat currency, but in reverse. Bitcoin maintains a fixed supply and infinite price potential because its fiat counterpart has unlimited supply and declining value — the more fiat printed, the higher Bitcoin rises. Welsh Street applies this principle by pairing WELSH's fixed supply with STREET's controlled emissions. As liquidity providers sell STREET rewards for additional WELSH, constant buy pressure emerges on WELSH, creating an inverse relationship to traditional monetary inflation. 

The exchange transforms WELSH from an idle community asset into the foundation of an active DeFi economy, providing the missing economic engine that enables continuous market activity, yield generation, and ecosystem growth.

## From Wall Street to Welsh Street

Web2 established Wall Street as the financial epicenter driving global economic activity. Web3 now introduces Welsh Street—the first DeFi protocol designed to transform idle community assets into productive economic engines.

This innovation transforms WELSH from a beloved community symbol into the foundation of a thriving DeFi economy. WELSH holders gain native yield opportunities, new participants discover compelling reasons to join the ecosystem, and the Welsh community receives the financial infrastructure necessary for sustained economic growth.
