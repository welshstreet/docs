## The WELSH STREET Technical Model

STREET represents a technical implementation in meme coin infrastructure - the introduction of an infinite-supply token to support the ecosystem of a fixed-supply community-coin WELSH.

1. **Sustainable Emissions** - Consistent token distribution for protocol participation
2. **Protocol-Owned Liquidity** - Permanent trading depth
3. **Community Governance** - Democratic control over monetary policy
4. **Bitcoin Alignment** - Honoring the original blockchain's timing
5. **Meme Utility** - Demonstrating meme coins can have technical infrastructure

STREET is the **technical engine that transforms idle WELSH into active DeFi infrastructure**, addressing the community coin liquidity problem that has limited WELSH's on-chain usage for three years.
