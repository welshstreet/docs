# Credit Token

CREDIT is the liquidity provider (LP) token of Welsh Street Exchange. CREDIT implements the SIP-010 fungible token standard and represents proportional ownership in the WELSH/STREET liquidity pool.

Unlike most DEXs that use internal accounting or NFT positions, Welsh Street issues tradable LP tokens. CREDIT tokens are fully transferable, enabling secondary markets and DeFi composability.

## Core Functions

### Burn
<div className="code-transparent">
```clarity
(define-public (burn (amount uint))
    (begin
      (asserts! (> amount u0) ERR_ZERO_AMOUNT)

      ;; Only street-market authorization for liquidity operations
      (asserts! (is-eq contract-caller .street-market) ERR_NOT_AUTHORIZED)
      (try! (ft-burn? credit amount tx-sender))
      (ok {
        amount: amount
      })
    )
)
```
</div>

### Mint
<div className="code-transparent">
```clarity
(define-public (mint (amount uint))
    (begin
      (asserts! (> amount u0) ERR_ZERO_AMOUNT)

      ;; Only street-market authorization for liquidity operations
      (asserts! (is-eq contract-caller .street-market) ERR_NOT_AUTHORIZED)
      (try! (ft-mint? credit amount tx-sender))
      (ok {
        amount: amount
      })
    )
)

```
</div>

### Transfer

<div className="code-transparent">
```clarity
(define-public (transfer
    (amount uint)
    (sender principal)
    (recipient principal)
    (memo (optional (buff 34)))
  )
  (begin
    (asserts! (> amount u0) ERR_ZERO_AMOUNT)

    ;; street-market authorization for liquidity operations
    (asserts! (or (is-eq contract-caller .street-market)

    ;; credit-market authorization for distribution tracking during transfers 
                  (is-eq contract-caller .credit-controller)) ERR_NOT_AUTHORIZED)
    (try! (ft-transfer? credit amount sender recipient))
    (match memo content (print content) 0x)
    (ok true)
  )
)
```
</div>


## Liquidity Token Models

### Tradable LP Tokens

```
WELSH + STREET → [Pool Contract] → CREDIT Token (SIP-010)
                                         ↓
                                  Tradable Asset
```

**Advantages**:
- Secondary markets for LP positions
- DeFi composability with other protocols
- Collateral usage while receiving fees
- Transparent ownership representation

### Internal Accounting

```
Multiple Tokens → [Pool Contract]
                         ↓
                  Internal Balances
```

**Limitations**:
- No LP position trading
- Limited protocol composability
- Must exit to realize value

### Supply Mechanics

CREDIT supply is dynamic — minted when users provide liquidity, burned when users remove liquidity. Only the `street-market.clar` contract can mint or burn CREDIT tokens via contract-caller authorization.
