# Swap Functions

## Overview

The Welsh Street Exchange implements a **constant product Automated Market Maker (AMM)** with integrated fee distribution for sustainable protocol growth. The swap functions `swap-a-b` and `swap-b-a` enable bidirectional token swapping between Welsh Corgi Coin (WELSH) and Street Token (STREET) using the mathematical formula `x * y = k`, where liquidity is preserved through constant product mechanics.

## Contract Architecture

The exchange maintains dual reserve pools and implements a **two-tier fee system** that supports both liquidity provider rewards and protocol treasury funding:

1. **Fee Component**: Goes directly to liquidity providers through the rewards system
2. **Revenue Component**: Funds protocol treasury for development and growth

## Core Swap Functions

### swap-a-b: Welsh → Street Swap

Exchanges Welsh tokens for Street tokens using constant product AMM mechanics with integrated fee distribution.

```clarity
(define-public (swap-a-b (amount-a uint))
  (let (
    (res-a (var-get reserve-a))
    (res-b (var-get reserve-b))
    (lock-a (var-get locked-a))
    (lock-b (var-get locked-b))
    (fee-total (/ (* amount-a (+ (var-get fee) (var-get rev))) BASIS))
    (rev-a (/ (* amount-a (var-get rev)) BASIS))
    (fee-a (/ (* amount-a (var-get fee)) BASIS))
    (amount-a-net (- amount-a fee-total))
    (num (* amount-a-net res-b))
    (den (+ res-a amount-a-net))
    (amount-b (/ num den))
    (amount-b-net amount-b)
    (res-a-new (+ res-a amount-a-net))
    (res-b-new (- res-b amount-b-net))
    (lock-a-new (if (> res-a u0) (/ (* lock-a res-a-new) res-a) lock-a))
    (lock-b-new (if (> res-b u0) (/ (* lock-b res-b-new) res-b) lock-b))
    (treasury (var-get treasury-address))
  )
    (begin
      (asserts! (> amount-a u0) ERR_ZERO_AMOUNT)
      (asserts! (> amount-b-net u0) ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT)
      (try! (contract-call? .welshcorgicoin transfer amount-a tx-sender .exchange none))
      (try! (transformer .welshcorgicoin rev-a treasury))
      (try! (transformer .welshcorgicoin fee-a .rewards))
      (try! (transformer .street amount-b-net tx-sender))
      (try! (contract-call? .rewards update-rewards-a fee-a))
      (var-set reserve-a res-a-new)
      (var-set reserve-b res-b-new)
      (var-set locked-a lock-a-new)
      (var-set locked-b lock-b-new)
      (ok {
        amount-in: amount-a,
        amount-out: amount-b-net,
        fee-a: fee-a,
        res-a: res-a,
        res-a-new: res-a-new,
        res-b: res-b,
        res-b-new: res-b-new,
        rev-a: rev-a })
      )
    )
  )
```

**Parameters:**
- `amount-a`: Amount of Welsh tokens to swap (in natural units)

**AMM Calculation Formula:**
The swap uses the constant product formula with fee deduction:
```
amount-a-net = amount-a - fee-total
amount-b = (amount-a-net * res-b) / (res-a + amount-a-net)
```

**Fee Distribution:**
- **Fee Component (`fee-a`)**: `(amount-a * fee) / BASIS` → Sent to rewards contract for liquidity providers
- **Revenue Component (`rev-a`)**: `(amount-a * rev) / BASIS` → Sent to treasury address for protocol growth
- **Net Input**: `amount-a-net = amount-a - fee-total` → Added to Welsh reserves

**Returns:**
- `amount-in`: Input Welsh token amount
- `amount-out`: Output Street token amount received by user
- `fee-a`: Welsh tokens allocated to liquidity provider rewards
- `res-a`/`res-a-new`: Welsh reserve amounts (before/after swap)
- `res-b`/`res-b-new`: Street reserve amounts (before/after swap)
- `rev-a`: Welsh tokens sent to treasury

**Requirements:**
- Input amount must be greater than zero
- Output amount must be greater than zero (prevents zero-output swaps)
- User must have sufficient Welsh token balance
- Liquidity pool must be initialized

## Swap Mechanics

### Constant Product AMM

The Welsh Street Exchange implements the **constant product formula**:
```
x * y = k
```

Where:
- `x` = Welsh token reserves (`reserve-a`)
- `y` = Street token reserves (`reserve-b`) 
- `k` = Constant product (maintained across swaps)

### Slippage and Price Impact

**Price Impact Calculation:**
Price impact increases with swap size relative to pool depth. Larger swaps experience higher slippage due to the constant product curve.

**Slippage Formula:**
```clarity
price-impact = 1 - (output-amount / (input-amount * current-rate))
```

### Reserve Updates

**Reserve Management:**
- **Welsh Reserves**: Updated with net input amount (after fees) for both swap directions
- **Street Reserves**: Updated with net input amount (after fees) for both swap directions
- **Atomic Updates**: Both reserves updated atomically to maintain consistency

## Integration Points

### Rewards System Integration

**Automatic Reward Distribution:**
```clarity
;; Fee allocation to rewards
(try! (transformer .welshcorgicoin fee-a .rewards))
(try! (contract-call? .rewards update-rewards-a fee-a))
```

**Benefits:**
- **Zero Dilution**: Existing LP holders receive proportional rewards immediately  
- **High Precision**: 9-decimal precision prevents rounding losses
- **Automatic Updates**: No manual intervention required for reward distribution

### Treasury Integration

**Protocol Revenue Flow:**
```clarity
;; Revenue allocation to treasury
(try! (transformer .welshcorgicoin rev-a treasury))
```

**Treasury Features:**
- **Configurable Address**: Treasury address can be updated by current treasury
- **Lock Protection**: Treasury can be permanently locked to prevent changes
- **Multi-Token Support**: Receives both Welsh and Street tokens from swaps

## Error Handling

### Error Constants

```clarity
(define-constant ERR_ZERO_AMOUNT (err u700))
```

**Swap-Specific Validations:**
- **Input Validation**: Prevents zero-amount swaps
- **Output Validation**: Prevents zero-output scenarios (insufficient liquidity)
- **Balance Validation**: Ensures sufficient user token balance
- **Reserve Validation**: Implicitly checks for initialized liquidity pools

### Edge Case Handling

**Slippage Protection:**
Users should implement slippage tolerance in their applications by:
1. Calculating expected output using current reserves
2. Setting minimum acceptable output amount
3. Comparing actual output with expectations

**Liquidity Depth Considerations:**
- Small pools: Higher price impact for large swaps
- Large pools: Lower price impact, better capital efficiency
- Zero liquidity: Swaps will fail with ERR_ZERO_AMOUNT

## Mathematical Properties

### Constant Product Preservation

**Invariant Maintenance:**
```clarity
;; Before swap: reserve-a * reserve-b = k
;; After swap: (reserve-a + amount-a-net) * (reserve-b - amount-b-net) = k
```

**Fee Impact on Reserves:**
Fees are extracted before the constant product calculation, ensuring:
1. Liquidity providers receive genuine rewards
2. Protocol receives sustainable revenue
3. AMM mechanics remain mathematically sound

### Arbitrage Resistance

**Price Discovery:**
The constant product curve creates natural arbitrage opportunities that:
- Align exchange prices with external markets
- Provide MEV opportunities for arbitrageurs
- Generate additional volume and fees for LP holders

## Security Features

### Access Controls

**Public Functions:**
- Both swap functions are publicly accessible
- No special permissions required for swapping

**Administrative Functions:**
- Fee/revenue rate updates restricted to contract owner
- Treasury management restricted to treasury address

### Economic Security

**MEV Protection:**
- Transparent fee structure prevents hidden extraction
- Predictable slippage based on mathematical formulas

**Liquidity Protection:**
- Constant product formula prevents reserve depletion
- Minimum fee rates ensure sustainable rewards
- Maximum fee rates prevent excessive extraction

## Usage Examples

### Basic Welsh → Street Swap

```clarity
;; Swap 1,000 Welsh tokens for Street tokens
(contract-call? .exchange swap-a-b u1000000000) ;; 1,000 tokens (6 decimals)

;; Expected behavior:
;; 1. Deducts 2% total fees (20 Welsh tokens at default rates)
;; 2. Uses 980 Welsh for constant product calculation
;; 3. Returns calculated Street tokens to user
;; 4. Distributes 10 Welsh to LP rewards, 10 Welsh to treasury
```

### Basic Street → Welsh Swap

```clarity
;; Swap 100,000 Street tokens for Welsh tokens  
(contract-call? .exchange swap-b-a u100000000000) ;; 100,000 tokens (6 decimals)

;; Expected behavior:
;; 1. Deducts 2% total fees (2,000 Street tokens at default rates)
;; 2. Uses 98,000 Street for constant product calculation
;; 3. Returns calculated Welsh tokens to user
;; 4. Distributes 1,000 Street to LP rewards, 1,000 Street to treasury
