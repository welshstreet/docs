# Street Token

STREET is the rewards token of the WELSH STREET ecosystem.  This page describes the technical implementation of STREET and describes various code blocks and functions not typically found SIP-010 standard tokens.  For a description of STREET's tokenomics including initial distribution and inflation schedule please visit the [Tokenomics](https://docs.WELSHSTREET.com/docs/tokenomics) section.

## The WELSH STREET Vision

STREET represents a paradigm shift in meme coin tokenomics - the introduction of an infinite-supply token to power the ecosystem and economy of a fixed-supply community-coin WELSH.

1. **Sustainable Yield** - Real returns for real utility
2. **Protocol-Owned Liquidity** - Permanent trading depth
3. **Community Governance** - Democratic control over monetary policy
4. **Bitcoin Alignment** - Honoring the original blockchain's timing
5. **Meme Innovation** - Proving meme coins can have serious utility

STREET isn't just another meme coin - it's the **economic engine that transforms idle WELSH into productive DeFi infrastructure**, directly solving the community coin utility problem that has limited WELSH's growth potential for three years.


## Inflation vs Emissions

For the purposes of this documentation, inflation and emissions will use the following definitions:

**Inflation**: refers to the rate at which the total token supply increases over time, typically expressed as a percentage per year.

**Emission**: refers to the absolute quantity of new tokens minted and distributed over time.


## Emission Triggers

The limitation or lack of internal triggers is by design. Stacks smart contracts (written in Clarity) only execute when explicitly called by a transaction that is included in Stacks block (anchored to Bitcoin) Stacks has no timers, daemons, background process, emitters, or schedulers that can call a function because it's consensus is programmatically linked to Bitcoin. This in-part is what makes Stacks so incredibly secure.

### Chainhooks

To trigger `emission-mint` contract calls, WELSH STREET user Hiro chainhooks. Chainhooks are an automation framework built specifically for Bitcoin and Stacks for this purpose!  Created by Hiro Systems, chainhooks are off-chain event-driven indexers that listen for specific events and execute contract calls when the conditions are met.

Every Bitcoin block, a Hiro chainhook executes the emission-mint function which mints 10,000 new STREET directly to the rewards contract.  This chainhook execution is throttled by Bitcoin blocks.  There is contract logic that only allows one STREET mint event to occur every Bitcoin block.

### Emission Security Features
- **Emission amount hardcoded** - Admin cannot change 10,000 token rate
- **Bitcoin block timing** - Aligned with Bitcoin's ~10 minute blocks
- **Rate limited** - Maximum 1 emission per block prevents spam
- **Direct to rewards** - Tokens mint directly to LP reward pool


### What's the worse that can happen?
- Chainhooks are off-chain infrastructure which can have down time.  In this case, a mint block maybe skipped, which just slows STREET's emission schedule.
- In the case of permanent or prolonged downtime, a conventional CRON job is setup as a backup.  Instead of firing exactly on a Bitcoin block, CRON job's listen for blockchain changes and from time-to-time can skip a block.  Again, this just slows STREET's emission sechule, which isn;t a bad thing.

## Technical Specifications

### Limited Admin Functions
- `emission-mint` - Trigger emissions (rate-limited, amount fixed)
- `flip-kill-switch` - One-way supply cap activation
- `STREET-mint` - Initial distribution (capped at 5B total)

### Immutable Parameters
- Emission amount (10,000 tokens) cannot be changed
- Emission interval (1 block) cannot be changed
- Kill switch is irreversible once activated
- STREET mint cap (5B) cannot be exceeded
