# Street Token

STREET is the rewards token of the Welsh Street Meme Rewards protocol. This page covers the technical implementation of STREET and documents contract functions that extend beyond the standard SIP-010 specification. For tokenomics details including initial distribution and emission schedule, see the [Tokenomics](https://docs.welshstreet.com/docs/tokenomics/overview) section.

## Core Functions

### Mint

The `mint` function uses the standard clarity function `ft-mint?` however has authoization restrictions to the `emission-controller` and `street-controller` contracts that manage the emission minting and NFT minting respectively.

<div className="code-transparent">
```clarity
(define-public (mint (amount uint) (recipient principal))
    (begin
      (asserts!
        (or
          ;; manages emission minting  
          (is-eq contract-caller .emission-controller)
          
          ;; manages NFT minting
          (is-eq contract-caller .street-controller)
        )
        ERR_NOT_AUTHORIZED
      )
      (try! (ft-mint? street amount recipient))
      (ok true)
    )
)
```
</div>


### Automated Initial Mint

Upon contract deployment, a one-time mint of 2B tokens are minted directly to the deployer for initial liquidity provisioning. This event only happens once at contract deployment and has not callable function. 

<div className="code-transparent">
```clarity
;; The Great Welsh $STREET TGE

(begin
  (try! (ft-mint? street u2000000000000000 (var-get contract-owner)))
)
```
</div>

## Supply Mechanics

STREET implements a fixed-emission, perpetual-supply token model.
