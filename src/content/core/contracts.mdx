# Contracts

A decentralized exchange (DEX) to support STREET, the world's first dedicated _meme emission token_, built on Stacks blockchain. The DEX enables swaps between WELSH Corgi Coin (WELSH) and STREET Token (STREET), liquidity provisioning, and a dedicated emission and distribution system for liquidity providers.

## Architecture

The contracts form an integrated DeFi ecosystem where:
- Users provide WELSH / STREET liquidity and receive CREDIT LP tokens
- Trading fees and STREET emissions accumulate in the distribution contract
- LP token holders can claim proportional rewards at any time
