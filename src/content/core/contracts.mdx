# Contracts Overview

A novel decentralized exchange (DEX) to support STREET, the world's first dedicated _meme rewards token_, built on Stacks blockchain. The DEX enables swaps between Welsh Corgi Coin (WELSH) and Street Token (STREET), liquidity provisioning (CREDIT), and a dedicated emission and rewards system for liquidity providers.

## Architecture

The contracts form an integrated DeFi ecosystem where:
- Users provide WELSH/STREET liquidity and receive CREDIT LP tokens
- Trading fees and STREET emissions accumulate in the rewards contract
- LP token holders can claim proportional rewards at any time
- The system maintains token reserves and reward distributions automatically

## Core Contracts

The Welsh Street protocol consists of four interconnected smart contracts that work together to honor WELSH's legacy while creating a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem:

### Credit

- **Contract:** `credit.clar`
- **LP Tokens**: Manages liquidity provider (LP) token issuance and tracking
- CREDIT tokens represent proportional ownership of liquidity pools
- Handles minting, burning, and balance management for LP positions
