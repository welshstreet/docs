# Contracts

A decentralized exchange (DEX) to support $STREET, the world's first dedicated _meme rewards token_, built on Stacks blockchain. The DEX enables swaps between Welsh Corgi Coin (WELSH) and Street Token (STREET), liquidity provisioning, and a dedicated emission and rewards system for liquidity providers.

## Architecture

The contracts form an integrated DeFi ecosystem where:
- Users provide WELSH/STREET liquidity and receive CREDIT LP tokens
- Trading fees and STREET emissions accumulate in the rewards contract
- LP token holders can claim proportional rewards at any time
