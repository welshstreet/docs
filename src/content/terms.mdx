# Terms of Service

## Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Welsh Street website (welshstreet.com), the Welsh Street Exchange (app.welshstreet.com), and the Welsh Street Documentation (docs.welshstreet.com), APIs, or interfaces (collectively, the "Service"), including connecting a wallet to swap tokens, provide or remove liquidity, or claim rewards, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms") and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## Eligibility & Compliance

You represent and warrant that you are of legal age and have capacity to enter a binding agreement; you are not in a sanctioned or prohibited jurisdiction; and your use complies with applicable laws (including securities, commodities, tax, AML, and sanctions). You are solely responsible for understanding and following all laws applicable to your activity.

## Non-Custodial; Wallets; On-Chain Transactions

- The Service is a non-custodial interface to blockchain protocols. We do not custody, hold, or have access to your assets, keys, or funds at any time.
- All blockchain transactions are executed by you directly via your connected wallet and are typically final and irreversible once submitted.
- You are solely responsible for securing your wallet, safeguarding private keys/seed phrases, and reviewing and managing token approvals/allowances at your own risk.
- You are responsible for all network gas, protocol, and third-party fees.

## Core Functions: Swaps, Liquidity, Rewards

- **Swaps**: Quotes are indicative; execution is not guaranteed. Slippage, failed transactions, and miner/maximal extractable value (MEV) may occur.
- **Provide/Remove Liquidity**: You may incur impermanent loss and may not withdraw the same assets or ratio that you deposited.
- **Rewards**: APR/APY figures are estimates only, provided as an example, and subject to change without notice.

## Risk Disclosures

By using the Service, you acknowledge and accept the following risks:
- **Market/Price Risk**: Extreme volatility, including the risk of total loss.
- **Liquidity Risk**: High slippage, pool imbalances, and inability to exit positions.
- **Impermanent Loss**: Liquidity providers may receive fewer assets than deposited.
- **Smart Contract Risk**: Vulnerabilities, bugs, or exploits may occur; audits do not eliminate risk. Contracts operate "as is."
- **Custody/Key Risk**: If you lose access to your wallet, seed phrase, or private keys, funds cannot be recovered.
- **Network Risk**: Blockchain congestion, forks, reorganizations, outages, or gas spikes.
- **Oracle Risk**: Price-feed inaccuracies, delays, or manipulation.
- **Regulatory and Tax Risk**: Laws may change; users are solely responsible for compliance.

## No Investment, Legal, or Tax Advice

All content is informational only and not investment, legal, accounting, or tax advice. We are not a broker, dealer, investment adviser, exchange, or custodian. Consult your professional advisors.

## Documentation Disclaimer

The documentation provided at docs.welshstreet.com is offered **as a courtesy and without warranties of any kind**. The Welsh Street Exchange is not responsible for discrepancies, errors, or unexpected contract behavior. Documentation may be updated, modified, or removed at any time, without prior notice or warning.

## Data & Privacy (Wallet Activity Logging)

We process limited data to operate, secure, and improve the Service. We record wallet activity related to this app: swaps, providing/removing liquidity, and reward claims (e.g., wallet address, transaction hashes, timestamps, token symbols/amounts, pool identifiers). We do not collect user-identifying information and do not collect IP addresses. Additional details are provided in the Privacy Policy below.

## Prohibited Uses

You will not use the Service for unlawful purposes (e.g., sanctions evasion, money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud), interfere with or abuse the Service, circumvent security, or scrape/reverse engineer where prohibited by law. We may restrict or terminate access for violations.

## Third-Party Protocols & Integrations

The Service may route orders or display data from third-party protocols, oracles, or APIs. We do not control their availability, security, pricing, or accuracy. Your interactions with third parties are solely between you and them.

## Token Listings & Information

Display of a token, pool, or market does not imply endorsement or verification. Information may be incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate.

## Fees

We may charge interface or service fees, disclosed at point of use or in documentation. Network gas and protocol fees are outside our control. Fees are non-refundable unless required by law.

## Taxes

You are solely responsible for all taxes arising from your use of the Service, including reporting and payment obligations.

## Contract Economics: Fees, Revenue, and Liquidity Tax

The Welsh Street Exchange smart contracts implement the following mechanisms:

- Swap Fee: A small percentage fee (typically 0.5%, with a hard-coded maximum of 5%) is applied to swaps. This fee is transferred to the rewards pool and distributed to liquidity providers.
- Swap Revenue: A small percentage (typically 0.5%, with a hard-coded maximum of 5%) may also be applied to swaps as exchange revenue. This revenue is transferred to the Exchange treasury and may be used at the discretion of the Exchange.
- Liquidity Tax: As part of anti-whale protection measures, an early withdrawal penalty “liquidity tax” (typically 10%, with a hard-coded maximum of 20% for extreme manipulation events) may apply to liquidity providers who remove liquidity before a minimum holding period. This mechanism is intended to protect users and the liquidity pool from manipulation.

This liquidity “tax” is not a government tax and should not be confused with legal tax obligations. Users remain solely responsible for recording, reporting, and paying any applicable taxes related to their transactions. The Welsh Street Exchange does not record, provide, or issue tax/accounting information to users.

## Intellectual Property

The Service (excluding open-source components and public on-chain data) is owned by Welsh Street, LLC. Subject to these Terms, we grant a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Service for its intended purpose.

## Changes to the Service and Terms

We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service and update these Terms by posting the revised version with a new "Last updated" date. Continued use constitutes acceptance.

## Disclaimers

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES, OR THAT RESULTS WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE.

## Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL [COMPANY] OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU DIRECTLY TO US FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 3 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM, OR (B) USD $100.

## Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Welsh Street, LLC and its affiliates from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any third-party rights.

## Arbitration; Class-Action Waiver (Consult Counsel)

Any dispute arising from these Terms or the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by American Arbitration Association under its rules. You and Welsh Street, LLC agree that disputes will be conducted only on an individual basis and not as a class action. Nothing here prevents either party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief for IP misuse or breach of confidentiality in a court of competent jurisdiction.

## Governing Law & Venue

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, excluding conflict-of-laws rules. Subject to the arbitration clause, the exclusive venue for permitted court actions is in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

## Termination

We may suspend or terminate access for any reason, including suspected violations of these Terms. Provisions that by their nature should survive (e.g., Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Arbitration, Governing Law) will survive termination.

## Severability; Entire Agreement; Assignment

If any provision is held invalid, the remainder remains in full force. These Terms and the Privacy Policy are the entire agreement between you and Welsh Street, LLC regarding the Service. You may not assign these Terms without our consent; we may assign them without restriction.
