# Roadmap

## Bootstrapping Phase

### Liquidity Generation Event

The Liquidity Generation Event (LGE) or Genesis is a fundraising event to pool community WELSH together to seed the initial WELSH / STREET liquidity pool.  A portion of the initial minted STREET supply will be distributed to contributors at the completion of the event.

### The Great Liquidity Burn

The deployer mints the first round of liquidity using the geometric mean. The liquidity is not immediately burned until traditional LP providers come onboard.  Early adopters always have a benefit for being early, but the slow liquidity burn guarantees the early adopters don't get a massive out-sized and unfair position to dump on future entrants.

The community may also decide, instead of burning these LP tokens, to list them on another exchange to be part of a secondary market.

## Adoption Phase

The economic flywheel begins when idle WELSH assets become productive through pairing with STREET tokens to generate yield. CREDIT tokens emerge as tradable LP positions that allow holders to claim rewards while maintaining market exposure. This initial phase transforms dormant community holdings into active economic participants through sustainable STREET emissions.

During the adoption pase, there will only be one liquidity pool, WELSH / STREET where users can claim STREET rewards and grow their WELSH holdings.  Then they may choose to provide more WELSH and STREET to earn more CREDIT.

During this phase there will be many community initiatives, especially on social media, including meme contests and trading contests. Welsh Street and the community may also elect to airdrop STREET to holders and users.

## Growth Phase

As the system matures, yield farmers begin earning and monetizing STREET rewards, creating the first wave of selling pressure that paradoxically strengthens the ecosystem. These STREET to WELSH swaps generate permanent buy pressure on the foundational token, while price differentials between Welsh Street Exchange and other DEXs create arbitrage opportunities that drive WELSH trading volume across the Stacks ecosystem.

## Expansion Phase

The hallmark of the expansion phase will be more STREET and CREDIT listings outside of the Welsh Street Exchange.  This phase will signal the broader adoption of STREET and CREDIT into the Stacks ecosystem.  This will include aggregating the WELSH / STREET pool and other pools into DEX aggregators such as Alex, Bitflow and Velar.

This phase also sees CREDIT tokens develop into valuable secondary market assets as professional market makers recognize their yield generation potential. Cross-protocol integration expands WELSH's trading volume and arbitrage opportunities across the broader Stacks DeFi landscape.

Welsh Street and the community may also utilize treasury reserves for STREET and CREDIT listings on other exchanges even beyond the Stacks ecosystem.
