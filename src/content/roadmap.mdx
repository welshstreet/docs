# Roadmap

Launching and growing the Welsh Street Exchange consists of three distinct and exciting phases:

Phase 1: Street Market - LGE, Bootstrapping and initial liquidity burn. \
Phase 2: Capital Market - Governance Token and Expansion Initiatives. \
Phase 3: *Future Market* - The third Welsh Street Exchange market remains a top secret.

First we launch, then we send **WELSH** to Wall Street, and finally, we go to the moon. 🚀

## Phase 1: Street Market

The bootstrapping phase begins with the launch of the *Street Market*, the first liquidity pool where providers supply **WELSH** and **STREET** to earn **CREDIT**. During this phase, there will only be one liquidity pool, **WELSH** / **STREET** where users can claim STREET rewards and grow their WELSH holdings.

The economic flywheel begins when idle **WELSH** assets become productive through pairing with **STREET** tokens to earn rewards. **CREDIT** holders may choose to provide more WELSH and STREET to earn more CREDIT. **CREDIT** tokens are also tradable LP positions that allow holders to claim rewards *without* withdrawing their liquidity position so compounding **CREDIT** positions more attractive than traditional liquidity pools.

### Liquidity Generation Event

The *Liquidity Generation Event (LGE)* or *Genesis* is a fundraising event to pool community **WELSH** together to seed the initial **WELSH** / **STREET** liquidity pool.  A portion of the initial minted **STREET** supply will be distributed to contributors at the completion of the event.

### The Great Liquidity Burn

The deployer mints the first round of liquidity using the geometric mean. The liquidity is not immediately burned until traditional LP providers come onboard.  Early adopters always have a benefit for being early, but the slow liquidity burn guarantees the early adopters don't get a massive out-sized and unfair position to dump on future entrants.

The community may also decide, instead of burning these LP tokens, to list them on another exchange to be part of a secondary market.

### TL;DR

- Phase: Bootstrapping
- Core Market: *Street Market* (`street-market`)
- Purpose:  Primary price discovery and liquidity formation
- Trading pair: **WELSH ⇄ STREET**
- Liquidity token: **CREDIT**
- CREDIT represents proportional ownership of the Street Market pool

## Phase 2: Capital Market

As the bootstrapping phase matures, yield farmers begin monetizing **STREET** rewards, creating the first wave of selling pressure that paradoxically strengthens the ecosystem. These **STREET** to **WELSH** swaps generate permanent buy pressure on the foundational token **WELSH**, while price differentials between Welsh Street Exchange and other DEXs create arbitrage opportunities that further drive **WELSH** trading volume across the Stacks ecosystem.

### Governance

**STREET** and **CREDIT** holders will be looking for more ways to monetize their rewards and grow the Welsh Street Exchange. This will necessitate more community participation and coordination leading to the launch of the Welsh Street Governance Token **TBD**

As **CREDIT** is a tradable and composable SIP-010 token, **CREDIT** will be paired with another ecosystem token to form the Governance LP position **TBD**. **TBD**, like **CREDIT** will be a tradable LP position but enabling holders to earn boosted **STREET** rewards and take place in governance votes to shape and steer the future of Welsh Street.

### Expansion

The Capital Market phase will signal the broader adoption of **STREET** and **CREDIT** into the Stacks ecosystem.  This phase will include listing **STREET** tokens on other exchanges. These **STREET** tokens will come from the Treasurt Reserves built-up during the bootstrapping phase.

This phase also sees **CREDIT** tokens develop into a valuable secondary market asset as market makers recognize the yield generation potential through continued rewards and arbitrage. The expansion phase will also include aggregating the **WELSH** / **STREET** pool and other pools into DEX aggregators such as Alex, Bitflow and Velar. These Cross-protocol integrations will continue to expand **WELSH's** trading volume and arbitrage opportunities across the broader Stacks DeFi landscape.

### TL;DR

- Phase: Governance & Expansion
- Core Market: *Capital Market* (`capital-market`)
- Purpose: Growth, Expansion and Governance
- Trading pair: **WELSH ⇄ STREET ⇄ CREDIT**
- Governance token: **TBD**
- **TBD** represents governance of the Welsh Street Exchange

## Phase 3: *Future Market*

The Future of **WELSH** is exciting.  The Welsh Street Exchange represents a first of its kind: A dedicated Meme Rewards DEX build on top of a dog meme coin. But not any dog, Bitcoin's first dog coin built on the leading Bitcoin L2: Stacks.

With the success of the Street Market, and as the Welsh Street Exchange matures into the governance phase, we'll share more details of the *future market* plans.  Until then, sit back and enjoy those sweet, sweet Street Credit rewards.
